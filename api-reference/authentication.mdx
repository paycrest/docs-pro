All API requests require authentication using your **API Key** and **API Secret**.

## API-Key Header

Include your **API Key** in the `API-Key` header for every API request:

```http
API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

- You can find your API Key in your dashboard.
- Requests without a valid or correct API-Key will return **401 Unauthorized**.

<Warning>
Do not commit your API keys to git, or use them in client-side code. Never share your API Secret. If you believe it has been compromised, rotate it immediately in your dashboard.
</Warning>

## API Secret

Your **API Secret** is used for sensitive operations such as verifying webhook signatures and should **never** be shared or exposed in client-side code.

<Warning>
Keep your API Secret safe. The API Secret is for server-side use only (e.g., webhook signature verification). Never expose it in frontend code, public repositories, or logs.
</Warning>

## Webhook Signature Verification

When receiving webhooks, use your API Secret to verify the authenticity of the payload. Refer to the webhook documentation for implementation details.

<Warning>
Always ensure your server verifies the SSL connection to Paycrest. Do not set SSL verification (e.g., `VERIFY_PEER`) to `FALSE` in your HTTP client.
