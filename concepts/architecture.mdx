The Paycrest protocol is built on a modular, decentralized architecture that enables seamless stablecoin-to-fiat and fiat-to-stablecoin transactions. This section explains the core technical components and how they work together.

## Core Components

### Gateway Contract

The **Gateway contract** is the central entry point for all payment orders in the protocol.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Fulfillment">
    Provider executes payment to recipient
  </Step>
  <Step title="Settlement">
    Onchain settlement and fee distribution
  </Step>
</Steps>
